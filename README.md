# Project Name
Forum - Mobile Full Stack

## Project summary
A convenient and practical political information platform can provide people with convenient information services. We want a news media that focuses on providing political information to American citizens. Users can easily use it on mobile terminals or access it through web pages. Information channels are guaranteed, and all information is obtained from government websites.

### One-sentence description of the project
Forum is an app for citizens to get information about the United States government, the focus of this application is on displaying the political system as concisely as possible, while still retaining quality and accuracy.

### Additional information about the project
With all the different social media platforms out there our client felt that it was a focused, single location for political information. Users do not have to visit multiple websites to obtain information, our goal is to aggregate all reliable information.
